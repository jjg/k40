I should have started this journal a few weeks ago, but better late than never.

Here's a table of what I've bought so far:

Qty. | Price | Item | Notes
-----|-------|------|------
1 | 380.66 | K40 laser cutter kit | eBay
5 | ?? | 1 gallon distilled water | Fleet Farm
1 | ?? | 5 gallon bucket & lid | Fleet Farm
1 | 14.99 | Flow meter | Amazon
1 | ?? | Short USB cable | lab stock
1 | 11.29 | Exhaust manifold | Amazon
1 | 7.99 | 4" exhaust hose & 2 clamps | Amazon
1 | 18.99 | 4" in-line exhaust fan | Amazon
1 | 5.28 | Louvered exhaust port | Amazon
1 | 8.29 | 0-30mA panel meter | Amazon
1 | 27? | 4'x4'x3/4" plywood sheet | Hardware Hank
2 | ?? | 4" hose clamp | Hardware Hank
1 | 30.00 | Laser safety goggles | Amazon
1 | 13.99 | Air assist and laser cross holder | eBay
1 | 2.99 | Red cross line laser | eBay

I also wrote a blog post describing the setup so far: https://jasongullickson.com/posts/lasertime/

Using this configuration I made a few runs at engraving some material with the following results:

Material | Power | Speed | Air Assist |  Results
---------|-------|-------|------------|---------
Cardboard | 10% | 500 mm/s | no | Clean if shallow engraving
Cardboard | 10% | 100 mm/s | no | Cuts/burns dirty
Linoleum | 13% | 100 mm/s | no | Marks but doesn't etch very deep
Linoleum | 20% | 50 mm/s | no | Engraves deeply, lots of smoke and charring

During some of these tests the laser would stop before finishing a job.  I researched a number of potential causes but after swapping-out the long (6'?) USB cable that came with the machine for a short (6"?) one the interruptions did not return.

It's clear from the results of these first tests that the machine requires the following upgrades before I can start using it on a regular basis:

* Air assist
* Replacement bed
* Additional exaust capacity
* More accurate measurement of laser power

I have parts on-order to address all three of these areas.  I hope to have some time next weekend to implement some or all of these measures.  I'm still deciding how I want to address the issues with the stock bed, but I'm leaning toward a self-adjusting system like the one described here:

I should be able to source most of these parts locally, the only one I'm not sure about is the "expanded metal sheet" (although I could probably come-up with an alternative for that).
